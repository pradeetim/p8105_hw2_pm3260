# Problem 1

``` r
nyc_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,
    route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, 
    route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, 
    entrance_type, entry, vending, ada) |>
  mutate(entry_logical = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The NYC Transit data frame contains the variables that describe routes,
entry and entrance type, ADA compliance, station
name/latitude/longitude, lines, and vending.

So far, I have cleaned the names to make them all lower case and
selected the variables above to remain in the data set.

The dimensions of this data set is 1868 rows and 20 columns. The data is
NOT tidy.

There are 465 distinct stations.

There are 84 ADA compliant stations.

37% of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance.

# Problem 2

### Importing Mr. Trash Wheel Data

``` r
mrtrash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    range="A2:N587", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(
      round(sports_balls, 0)),
    year = as.numeric(year),
    trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```

### Importing Prof. Trash Wheel Data

``` r
proftrash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    range="A2:M109", 
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
```

### Importing Gwynnda Trash Wheel Data

``` r
gwyntrash_df = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    range="A2:L159", 
    sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```

### Merging datasets

``` r
trash_df =
  bind_rows(mrtrash_df, proftrash_df, gwyntrash_df)
```

### Paragraph description of data:

The three data sets are from different sheets of the same excel file.
They were imported so that the rows and columns all had data and then
merged. Before the merge, a new variable to indicate which sheet they
came from was added.

After the merge in `trash_df`, there were 845 observations and 15
variables (dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel).

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 216.26
tons.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of 2022
was 18120.

# Problem 3

### Importing bakers dataset

``` r
bakers_df = 
  read.csv("data/gbb_datasets/bakers.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    baker = word(baker_name, 1),
    baker = if_else(
      baker == "Jo", "Joanne", baker)) |>
  select(baker, series, baker_age, baker_occupation, hometown) |>
  arrange(series)
```

### Importing bakes dataset

``` r
bakes_df = 
  read.csv("data/gbb_datasets/bakes.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(baker, series, episode, everything()) |>
  mutate(baker = if_else(
    baker == '"Jo"', "Joanne", baker))
```

### Importing results dataset

``` r
results_df = 
  read.csv("data/gbb_datasets/results.csv", skip=2) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(baker, series, episode, everything())
```

### Merging with left_join

``` r
bakes_results_df = 
 left_join(
   results_df, bakes_df, by = c("baker", "series", "episode")
   )

bakeoff_df=
  left_join(
    bakes_results_df, bakers_df, by = c("baker", "series")) |>
  select(
    baker, series, episode, everything()
    )
```

### Export

``` r
write_csv(bakeoff_df, "data/gbb_datasets/bakeoff.csv")
```

### Data cleaning process:

I first started by importing all three data sets and taking a look at
the variables that were present in each one. When I saw that some
variables were repeating like name of the baker and series, it gave me a
point to start off from.

starting with the bakers data set, there were several things I had to
change. First of all, the names included both first and last name so I
had to keep just the first to match the other two data sets. Second, I
realized the name ‘Jo’ was typed three different ways through out the
data sets. I decided to keep it long as ‘Joanne’ and changed the bakers
and bakes data set to match.

When merging, I decided to use two steps because I realized baker data
set did not have the episodes variable. So I first merged results and
bakes (by baker, series and episode). Then I did that data set +
baker_df by baker and series. I think this helped keep the integrity of
the data.

the final data set has the name of the baker, their series, and the
episode in that order. Then it gives details of the bakers (from baker
data set), their bakes, and is they won or not in that episode.

### Creating a table

``` r
table_df = bakeoff_df |>
  filter(
    result %in% c("STAR BAKER", "WINNER"), 
    series >= 5) |>
  select(series, episode, baker, result) |>
  arrange(series, episode) |>
  knitr::kable(caption = "GBBO Star Bakers and Winners")

table_df
```

GBBO Star Bakers and Winners

### Comments:

Looking at the table, we can see that most of the winners had gotten
star baker earlier in the season at least once. The number of times you
got star bakers doesn’t seem to matter as winners ranged from being the
star baker from as low as 1 time to as high as 3 times per their season.
However, in Season 10, the winner was David, who has not won star baker
even once during the season, which seems like a surprise.
